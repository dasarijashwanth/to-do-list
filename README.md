A simple and user-friendly **To-Do List webpage** that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. The webpage is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and it lets users add, mark, and delete tasks. The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing or closing the webpage.
